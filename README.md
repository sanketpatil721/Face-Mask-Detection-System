# Face-Mask-Detection-System
In this project, I used Python and machine learning to develop a real-time face mask detection system using machine learning and deep learning to classify individuals with or without masks. Collected and pre-processed datasets containing images of people with and without masks, including resizing, array conversion,and label encoding. Utilized Python libraries like TensorFlow, Keras, and OpenCV for image processing and detection. Implemented the system to detect and classify masked/unmasked faces from live video streams, providing real-time visual feedback.
